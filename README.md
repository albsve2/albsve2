## Hello and welcome!

Iâ€™m currently in the first year of my two-year M.Sc. in Data analysis and AI at Uppsala University, where I will build a strong foundation in algorithms, data structures, linear algebra and database design. Over the next semesters I plan to explore industrial analyticsâ€”working with digital twins, production philosophies and AI-driven maintenance and process optimization. On the systems side, Iâ€™ll design cloud-native data pipelines, master both SQL and NoSQL storage, and tackle distributed architectures and real-time streaming. In parallel, Iâ€™m set to deepen my expertise in machine learning by studying statistical and probabilistic methods, developing prescriptive analytics models, and experimenting with simulation and reinforcement learning. Finally, I will focus on information retrieval, advanced image analysis and my 30-credit thesis in computer science, all with the goal of turning complex data into actionable insights.

As my B.Sc. Thesis i developed an AI-based vision system for automatic battery sorting with real-time detection and robot integration.
